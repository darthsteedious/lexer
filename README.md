# lexer
A very simple Lexer written in Rust

This can parse very simple expressions like the following:

    if (i == j)
        z = 1234;
    else
        z = 4321;
  
    if (i == 1)
      x = foo();
    else if (i == 5)
      x = bar();
    
### Usage ###
To test from command line: `cargo run` from within the project directory
